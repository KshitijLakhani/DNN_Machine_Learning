# DNN_Machine_Learning
Implementation of some basic Machine Learning Tasks like logistic and linear regression, simple image classification, Deep CNNs, etc. using python and keras primarily


EX1 and EX2 are basic tensorflow examples for training a simple single neuron NN and for getting used to TF.
Other locally developed examples deal with Keras libraries and larger applications - will be uploaded after few tweaks.
